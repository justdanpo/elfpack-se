III. Text masks
"$code" changes to need label

$0 = $t - title
$1 = $a - album
$2 = $c - composer
$3 = $g - genre
$4 = $y - year
$5 = $b - bitrate
$6 = $f - frequency
$7 = $m - mode
$8 = $l - length
$9 = $n - track num
$s = current time
$e = time left
$i = number of current song in playlist
$p = count of tracks in playlists

For example, writing down "$bkb/s | $s/$l/-$e" you will get "320kb/s | 02:31/03:58/-01:27" 

*************************************
IV. Editing scripts
There are some base commands:
[ACTIONS_COUNT]: 112; //Count of actions in script. Must be in every script
[UPDATE_TIME]: 1000; //Update time. Default = 1000
[USED_LABELS]: 012; //used in script labels. (you CANT write here cover and custom image!) It really changes labels positions..
[HIDE_WHEN_ISNT_IN_STANDBY]: 012; //Labels, that you need to hide when you are not in standby

Then goes description of actions. Numeration from 0!
A): B:C:D:E:F:G:H:I:J:K;
„‰Â 
A - index of action
B - index of label. (from 0!). 10 - cover, 11 - custom image
C - X-position. Negative characters are supported in all coords!
D - Y-position
E - max X position
F - max Y pos
G - Main color. Not a hex, it is dec! For example, 0xFF000000 after converting with windows calculator will be 4278190080
     0 - don't change color
H - Highlight color
I - font code. 0 -don't change
J - Centering. 3 - don't change
K - How many actions you'll need to do after this. 
Example: when you enter "4", script will be executed by 4-actions' blocks

Don't forget that you have test-script, here is some usefull info, too =)
